# Password Generator

This code generates a random password that meets specific criteria to ensure the creation of a strong and secure password.

## Usage
The password generator provides a user-friendly interface for generating a password. When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts for password criteria are presented. The user can then select their preferred criteria to include in the password.

## Password Length
The system prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password. The user can choose a length between 8 and 128 characters.

## Character Types
Next, the system asks the user to select the character types to include in the password. The user can confirm whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric digits, and/or special characters. It is important to note that at least one character type must be selected.

## Password Generation
Once the user has answered all the prompts and the input has been validated, the password generator generates a password that matches the selected criteria.

## Displaying the Password
The generated password can be displayed in an alert or written directly to the page, depending on the implementation.

## Security Considerations
Creating a strong and secure password is essential for protecting sensitive information. The password generator ensures randomness and includes a variety of character types to enhance security.

It is recommended to use the generated password immediately and avoid storing it in plain text. Additionally, it is advisable to change passwords periodically and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.
