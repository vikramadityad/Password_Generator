Next, the system asks the user to select the character types to include in the password. The user can confirm whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric digits, and/or special characters. It is important to note that at least one character type must be selected.

## Password Generation
Once the user has answered all the prompts and the input has been validated, the password generator generates a password that matches the selected criteria.
